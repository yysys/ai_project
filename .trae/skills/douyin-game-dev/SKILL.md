# Douyin Mini-Game Developer

This skill handles development of Douyin (TikTok) mini-games. All game code is located in the `./game` directory.

## Directory Structure

```
./game/
├── src/           # Source code
├── assets/        # Game assets (images, audio, etc.)
├── config/        # Configuration files
└── game.json      # Game manifest
```

## Key Tasks

### 1. Game Initialization
- Set up new mini-game project structure
- Configure game.json with proper settings
- Initialize necessary files and folders

### 2. Core Development
